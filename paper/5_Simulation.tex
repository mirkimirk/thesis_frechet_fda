We see a more continous estimate in the Fr√©chet regression. Clearly the mean shifts
steadily to the right, as x increases, as well as more variance.

Because in the functional regression on the log transformed qds, we have to adjust with
the range with the individual quantile of the observation, and otherwise there is no
possibility to keep the mean, the linear dependence of the mean is lost. One can though
see that the variance rises with x. This information is not lost in the log qdfs.
