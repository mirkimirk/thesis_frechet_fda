\subsection{Functional Principal Component Analysis}
\label{sec:fpca}
The most popular method for describing structure in our functional data is Functional
Principal Component analysis (FPCA). This is an analogue to Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) from multivariate statistics in the case of infinite dimensions. It builds on the
Karhunen-Lo√®ve decomposition (described in the section \ref{sec:mercer and kh}) to
recover functions that describe the main modes of variation, in descending order.

We computed the discretized grid as described in \citet[Chapter~8.4.1]{RamsaySilverman2005}. Another analogous way
is described in \textcite{KneipUtikal2001}. (\textcite{Delicado2011} SUMMARIZES THIS.)
