Retaining the unique approach of the previous editions, this text interweaves material on probability and measure, so that probability problems generate an interest in measure theory and measure theory is then developed and applied to probability. Probability and Measure provides thorough coverage of probability, measure, integration, random variables and expected values, convergence of distributions, derivatives and conditional probability, and stochastic processes. The Third Edition features an improved treatment of Brownian motion and the replacement of queuing theory with ergodic theory.  Like the previous editions, this new edition will be well received by students of mathematics, statistics, economics, and a wide variety of disciplines that require a solid understanding of probability theory.},

  abstract = {This book is based on the author's experience with calculations involving polynomial splines. It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series.},

  abstract = {The analysis of samples of random objects that do not lie in a vector space is gaining increasing attention in statistics. An important class of such object data is univariate probability measures defined on the real line. Adopting the Wasserstein metric, we develop a class of regression models for such data, where random distributions serve as predictors and the responses are either also distributions or scalars. To define this regression model, we use the geometry of tangent bundles of the space of random measures endowed with the Wasserstein metric for mapping distributions to tangent spaces. The proposed distribution-to-distribution regression model provides an extension of multivariate linear regression for Euclidean data and function-to-function regression for Hilbert space-valued data in functional data analysis. In simulations, it performs better than an alternative transformation approach where one maps distributions to a Hilbert space through the log quantile density transformation and then applies traditional functional regression. We derive asymptotic rates of convergence for the estimator of the regression operator and for predicted distributions and also study an extension to autoregressive models for distribution-valued time series. The proposed methods are illustrated with data on human mortality and distributional time series of house prices.},

  abstract = {Summary. We show that, in functional data classification problems, perfect asymptotic classification is often possible, making use of the intrinsic very high dimensional nature of functional data. This performance is often achieved by linear methods, which are optimal in important cases. These results point to a marked contrast between classification for functional data and its counterpart in conventional multivariate analysis, where the dimension is kept fixed as the sample size diverges. In the latter setting, linear methods can sometimes be quite inefficient, and there are no prospects for asymptotically perfect classification, except in pathological cases where, for example, a variance vanishes. By way of contrast, in finite samples of functional data, good performance can be achieved by truncated versions of linear methods. Truncation can be implemented by partial least squares or projection onto a finite number of principal components, using, in both cases, cross-validation to determine the truncation point. We establish consistency of the cross-validation procedure.},

  abstract = {Modeling conditional distributions for functional data extends the concept of a mean response in functional regression settings, where vector predictors are paired with functional responses. This extension is challenging because of the nonexistence of well-defined densities, cumulative distributions, or quantile functions in the Hilbert space where the response functions are located. To address this challenge, we simplify the problem by assuming that the response functions are Gaussian processes, which means that the conditional distribution of the responses is determined by conditional mean and conditional covariance. We demonstrate that these quantities can be obtained by applying global and local Fréchet regression, where the local version is more flexible and applicable when the covariate dimension is low and covariates are continuous, while the global version is not subject to these restrictions but is based on the assumption of a more restrictive regression relation. Convergence rates for the proposed estimates are obtained under the framework of M-estimation. The corresponding estimation of conditional distributions is illustrated with simulations and an application to bike-sharing data, where predictors include weather characteristics and responses are bike rental profiles. We also show that our methods are applicable to the challenging problem to study functional fragments. Such data are observed in accelerated longitudinal studies and correspond to functional data observed over short domain segments. We demonstrate the utility of conditional distributions in this context by using the time (age) at which a subject enters the domain of a fragment in addition to other covariates as predictor and the function observed over the domain of the fragment as response.},

This book starts from theoretical foundations including functional nonparametric modeling, description of the mathematical framework, construction of the statistical methods, and statements of their asymptotic behaviors. It proceeds to computational issues including R and S-PLUS routines. Several functional datasets in chemometrics, econometrics, and pattern recognition are used to emphasize the wide scope of nonparametric functional data analysis in applied sciences. The companion Web site includes R and S-PLUS routines, command lines for reproducing examples presented in the book, and the functional datasets.  Rather than set application against theory, this book is really an interface of these two features of statistics. A special effort has been made in writing this book to accommodate several levels of reading. The computational aspects are oriented toward practitioners whereas open problems emerging from this new field of statistics will attract Ph.D. students and academic researchers. Finally, this book is also accessible to graduate students starting in the area of functional statistics.},

Data in the form of samples of densities or distributions are increasingly encountered in statistical analysis and there is a need for flexible regression models that accommodate random densities as responses. Such models are of special interest for multivariate continuous predictors, where unrestricted nonparametric regression approaches are subject to the curse of dimensionality. Additive models can be expected to maintain one-dimensional rates of convergence while permitting a substantial degree of flexibility. This motivates the development of additive regression models for situations where multivariate continuous predictors are coupled with densities as responses. To overcome the problem that distributions do not form a vector space, we utilize a class of transformations that map densities to unrestricted square integrable functions and then deploy an additive functional regression model to fit the responses in the unrestricted space, finally transforming back to density space. We implement the proposed additive model with an extended version of smooth backfitting and establish the consistency of this approach, including rates of convergence. The proposed method is illustrated with an application to the distributions of baby names in the United States.},

All procedures are described algorithmically, illustrated on simulated and real data sets, and supported by a complete asymptotic theory. The book can be read at two levels. Readers interested primarily in methodology will find detailed descriptions of the methods and examples of their application. Researchers interested also in mathematical foundations will find carefully developed theory. The organization of the chapters makes it easy for the reader to choose an appropriate focus.

To address this problem, we introduce a transformation approach, mapping probability densities to a Hilbert space of functions through a continuous and invertible map. Basic methods of functional data analysis, such as the construction of functional modes of variation, functional regression or classification, are then implemented by using representations of the densities in this linear space. Representations of the densities themselves are obtained by applying the inverse map from the linear functional space to the density space. Transformations of interest include log quantile density and log hazard transformations, among others. Rates of convergence are derived for the representations that are obtained for a general class of transformations under certain structural properties. If the subject-specific densities need to be estimated from data, these rates correspond to the optimal rates of convergence for density estimation. The proposed methods are illustrated through simulations and applications in brain imaging.},

To address the need for statistical methods for such data, we introduce the concept of Fréchet regression. This is a general approach to regression when responses are complex random objects in a metric space and predictors are in \$\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\^\{p\}\$, achieved by extending the classical concept of a Fréchet mean to the notion of a conditional Fréchet mean. We develop generalized versions of both global least squares regression and local weighted least squares smoothing. The target quantities are appropriately defined population versions of global and local regression for response objects in a metric space. We derive asymptotic rates of convergence for the corresponding fitted regressions using observed data to the population targets under suitable regularity conditions by applying empirical process methods. For the special case of random objects that reside in a Hilbert space, such as regression models with vector predictors and functional data as responses, we obtain a limit distribution. The proposed methods have broad applicability. Illustrative examples include responses that consist of probability distributions and correlation matrices, and we demonstrate both global and local Fréchet regression for demographic and brain imaging data.

  abstract = {Scientists today collect samples of curves and other functional observations. This monograph presents many ideas and techniques for such data. Included are expressions in the functional domain of such classics as linear regression, principal components analysis, linear modelling, and canonical correlation analysis, as well as specifically functional techniques such as curve registration and principal differential analysis. Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drwan from growth analysis, meterology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields. Much of the material is based on the authors' own work, some of which appears here for the first time. Jim Ramsay is Professor of Psychology at McGill University and is an international authority on many aspects of multivariate analysis. He draws on his collaboration with researchers in speech articulation, motor control, meteorology, psychology, and human physiology to illustrate his technical contributions to functional data analysis in a wide range of statistical and application journals. Bernard Silverman, author of the highly regarded "Density Estimation for Statistics and Data Analysis," and coauthor of "Nonparametric Regression and Generalized Linear Models: A Roughness Penalty Approach," is Professor of Statistics at Bristol University. His published work on smoothing methods and other aspects of applied, computational, and theoretical statistics has been recognized by the Presidents' Award of the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies, and the award of two Guy Medals by the Royal Statistical Society.},

  abstract = {Global Fréchet regression is an extension of linear regression to cover more general types of responses, such as distributions, networks, and manifolds, which are becoming more prevalent. In such models, predictors are Euclidean while responses are metric space valued. Predictor selection is of major relevance for regression modeling in the presence of multiple predictors but has not yet been addressed for Fréchet regression. Due to the metric space-valued nature of the responses, Fréchet regression models do not feature model parameters, and this lack of parameters makes it a major challenge to extend existing variable selection methods for linear regression to global Fréchet regression. In this work, we address this challenge and propose a novel variable selection method that overcomes it and has good practical performance. We provide theoretical support and demonstrate that the proposed variable selection method achieves selection consistency. We also explore the finite sample performance of the proposed method with numerical examples and data illustrations.},

  abstract = {This book is an introduction to the field of asymptotic statistics. The treatment is both practical and mathematically rigorous. In addition to most of the standard topics of an asymptotics course, including likelihood inference, M-estimation, the theory of asymptotic efficiency, U-statistics, and rank procedures, the book also presents recent research topics such as semiparametric models, the bootstrap, and empirical processes and their applications. The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation. Thus, even the standard subjects of asymptotic statistics are presented in a novel way. Suitable as a graduate or Master s level statistics text, this book will also give researchers an overview of the latest research in asymptotic statistics.},

  abstract = {This book provides an account of weak convergence theory, empirical processes, and their application to a wide variety of problems in statistics. The first part of the book presents a thorough treatment of stochastic convergence in its various forms. Part 2 brings together the theory of empirical processes in a form accessible to statisticians and probabilists. In Part 3, the authors cover a range of applications in statistics including rates of convergence of estimators; limit theorems for M− and Z−estimators; the bootstrap; the functional delta-method and semiparametric estimation. Most of the chapters conclude with “problems and complements.” Some of these are exercises to help the reader’s understanding of the material, whereas others are intended to supplement the text. This second edition includes many of the new developments in the field since publication of the first edition in 1996: Glivenko-Cantelli preservation theorems; new bounds on expectations of suprema of empirical processes; new bounds on covering numbers for various function classes; generic chaining; definitive versions of concentration bounds; and new applications in statistics including penalized M-estimation, the lasso, classification, and support vector machines. The approximately 200 additional pages also round out classical subjects, including chapters on weak convergence in Skorokhod space, on stable convergence, and on processes based on pseudo-observations.},

  abstract = {With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. These are both examples of functional data, which has become a commonly encountered type of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single- or multiple- index methods, we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models and models that feature time warping, manifold learning, and empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

By developing a tool on simultaneous diagonalization of two positive definite kernels, we obtain shaper results on the minimax rates of convergence and show that smoothness regularized estimators achieve the optimal rates of convergence for both prediction and estimation under conditions weaker than those for the functional principal components based methods developed in the literature. Despite the generality of the method of regularization, we show that the procedure is easily implementable. Numerical results are obtained to illustrate the merits of the method and to demonstrate the theoretical developments.},
