Retaining the unique approach of the previous editions, this text interweaves material on probability and measure, so that probability problems generate an interest in measure theory and measure theory is then developed and applied to probability. Probability and Measure provides thorough coverage of probability, measure, integration, random variables and expected values, convergence of distributions, derivatives and conditional probability, and stochastic processes. The Third Edition features an improved treatment of Brownian motion and the replacement of queuing theory with ergodic theory.  Like the previous editions, this new edition will be well received by students of mathematics, statistics, economics, and a wide variety of disciplines that require a solid understanding of probability theory.},

  abstract = {This book is based on the author's experience with calculations involving polynomial splines. It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series.},

  abstract = {Summary. We show that, in functional data classification problems, perfect asymptotic classification is often possible, making use of the intrinsic very high dimensional nature of functional data. This performance is often achieved by linear methods, which are optimal in important cases. These results point to a marked contrast between classification for functional data and its counterpart in conventional multivariate analysis, where the dimension is kept fixed as the sample size diverges. In the latter setting, linear methods can sometimes be quite inefficient, and there are no prospects for asymptotically perfect classification, except in pathological cases where, for example, a variance vanishes. By way of contrast, in finite samples of functional data, good performance can be achieved by truncated versions of linear methods. Truncation can be implemented by partial least squares or projection onto a finite number of principal components, using, in both cases, cross-validation to determine the truncation point. We establish consistency of the cross-validation procedure.},

  abstract = {Modeling conditional distributions for functional data extends the concept of a mean response in functional regression settings, where vector predictors are paired with functional responses. This extension is challenging because of the nonexistence of well-defined densities, cumulative distributions, or quantile functions in the Hilbert space where the response functions are located. To address this challenge, we simplify the problem by assuming that the response functions are Gaussian processes, which means that the conditional distribution of the responses is determined by conditional mean and conditional covariance. We demonstrate that these quantities can be obtained by applying global and local Fréchet regression, where the local version is more flexible and applicable when the covariate dimension is low and covariates are continuous, while the global version is not subject to these restrictions but is based on the assumption of a more restrictive regression relation. Convergence rates for the proposed estimates are obtained under the framework of M-estimation. The corresponding estimation of conditional distributions is illustrated with simulations and an application to bike-sharing data, where predictors include weather characteristics and responses are bike rental profiles. We also show that our methods are applicable to the challenging problem to study functional fragments. Such data are observed in accelerated longitudinal studies and correspond to functional data observed over short domain segments. We demonstrate the utility of conditional distributions in this context by using the time (age) at which a subject enters the domain of a fragment in addition to other covariates as predictor and the function observed over the domain of the fragment as response.},

This book starts from theoretical foundations including functional nonparametric modeling, description of the mathematical framework, construction of the statistical methods, and statements of their asymptotic behaviors. It proceeds to computational issues including R and S-PLUS routines. Several functional datasets in chemometrics, econometrics, and pattern recognition are used to emphasize the wide scope of nonparametric functional data analysis in applied sciences. The companion Web site includes R and S-PLUS routines, command lines for reproducing examples presented in the book, and the functional datasets.  Rather than set application against theory, this book is really an interface of these two features of statistics. A special effort has been made in writing this book to accommodate several levels of reading. The computational aspects are oriented toward practitioners whereas open problems emerging from this new field of statistics will attract Ph.D. students and academic researchers. Finally, this book is also accessible to graduate students starting in the area of functional statistics.},

An alternative approach based on quadratic regularisation is suggested and shown to have advantages from some points of view.},

Data in the form of samples of densities or distributions are increasingly encountered in statistical analysis and there is a need for flexible regression models that accommodate random densities as responses. Such models are of special interest for multivariate continuous predictors, where unrestricted nonparametric regression approaches are subject to the curse of dimensionality. Additive models can be expected to maintain one-dimensional rates of convergence while permitting a substantial degree of flexibility. This motivates the development of additive regression models for situations where multivariate continuous predictors are coupled with densities as responses. To overcome the problem that distributions do not form a vector space, we utilize a class of transformations that map densities to unrestricted square integrable functions and then deploy an additive functional regression model to fit the responses in the unrestricted space, finally transforming back to density space. We implement the proposed additive model with an extended version of smooth backfitting and establish the consistency of this approach, including rates of convergence. The proposed method is illustrated with an application to the distributions of baby names in the United States.},

As functional compositions, densities primarily carry relative information. As such, standard methods of functional data analysis (FDA) are not appropriate for their statistical processing. The specific features of density functions are accounted for in Bayes spaces, which result from the generalization to the infinite dimensional setting of the Aitchison geometry for compositional data. The aim is to build up a concise methodology for functional principal component analysis of densities. A simplicial functional principal component analysis (SFPCA) is proposed, based on the geometry of the Bayes space B2 of functional compositions. SFPCA is performed by exploiting the centred log-ratio transform, an isometric isomorphism between B2 and L2 which enables one to resort to standard FDA tools. The advantages of the proposed approach with respect to existing techniques are demonstrated using simulated data and a real-world example of population pyramids in Upper Austria.},

Such samples of curves often possess the following features: There is a typical structural pattern common to all curves of the sample. On the other hand, individual realizations of the typical shape show different dynamics and intensity. In particular, typical peaks are shifted from individual to individual. Differences in dynamics complicate the analysis of samples of curves. For example, the cross-sectional average usually does not reflect an average pattern. Due to shifts, structure is smeared or might even disappear. Our approach consists in synchronizing the individual curves before determining the average or any further statistics. Pointwise averaging of the synchronized curves then leads to an average curve which represents the common structure with average dynamics and average intensity. The method requires the introduction of new statistical objects. They are defined mathematically, their properties are discussed, and possible estimators are proposed. The asymptotic bias and variance of the estimators are derived. An application to visually evoked brain potentials illustrates the approach.},

Nonparametric Econometrics fills a major gap by gathering together the most up-to-date theory and techniques and presenting them in a remarkably straightforward and accessible format. The empirical tests, data, and exercises included in this textbook help make it the ideal introduction for graduate students and an indispensable resource for researchers.Nonparametric and semiparametric methods have attracted a great deal of attention from statisticians in recent decades. While the majority of existing books on the subject operate from the presumption that the underlying data is strictly continuous in nature, more often than not social scientists deal with categorical data—nominal and ordinal—in applied settings. The conventional nonparametric approach to dealing with the presence of discrete variables is acknowledged to be unsatisfactory.This book is tailored to the needs of applied econometricians and social scientists. Qi Li and Jeffrey Racine emphasize nonparametric techniques suited to the rich array of data types—continuous, nominal, and ordinal—within one coherent framework. They also emphasize the properties of nonparametric estimators in the presence of potentially irrelevant variables.Nonparametric Econometrics covers all the material necessary to understand and apply nonparametric methods for real-world problems.},

In many applications, density curves appear as functional response objects in a regression model with vector predictors. For such models, inference is key to understand the importance of density-predictor relationships, and the uncertainty associated with the estimated conditional mean densities, defined as conditional Fréchet means under a suitable metric. Using the Wasserstein geometry of optimal transport, we consider the Fréchet regression of density curve responses and develop tests for global and partial effects, as well as simultaneous confidence bands for estimated conditional mean densities. The asymptotic behavior of these objects is based on underlying functional central limit theorems within Wasserstein space, and we demonstrate that they are asymptotically of the correct size and coverage, with uniformly strong consistency of the proposed tests under sequences of contiguous alternatives. The accuracy of these methods, including nominal size, power and coverage, is assessed through simulations, and their utility is illustrated through a regression analysis of post-intracerebral hemorrhage hematoma densities and their associations with a set of clinical and radiological covariates.},

Due to the inherent constraints, densities do not live in a vector space and, therefore, commonly used Hilbert space based methods of functional data analysis are not applicable. To address this problem, we introduce a transformation approach, mapping probability densities to a Hilbert space of functions through a continuous and invertible map. Basic methods of functional data analysis, such as the construction of functional modes of variation, functional regression or classification, are then implemented by using representations of the densities in this linear space. Representations of the densities themselves are obtained by applying the inverse map from the linear functional space to the density space. Transformations of interest include log quantile density and log hazard transformations, among others. Rates of convergence are derived for the representations that are obtained for a general class of transformations under certain structural properties. If the subject-specific densities need to be estimated from data, these rates correspond to the optimal rates of convergence for density estimation. The proposed methods are illustrated through simulations and applications in brain imaging.},

To address the need for statistical methods for such data, we introduce the concept of Fréchet regression. This is a general approach to regression when responses are complex random objects in a metric space and predictors are in \$\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\^\{p\}\$, achieved by extending the classical concept of a Fréchet mean to the notion of a conditional Fréchet mean. We develop generalized versions of both global least squares regression and local weighted least squares smoothing. The target quantities are appropriately defined population versions of global and local regression for response objects in a metric space. We derive asymptotic rates of convergence for the corresponding fitted regressions using observed data to the population targets under suitable regularity conditions by applying empirical process methods. For the special case of random objects that reside in a Hilbert space, such as regression models with vector predictors and functional data as responses, we obtain a limit distribution. The proposed methods have broad applicability. Illustrative examples include responses that consist of probability distributions and correlation matrices, and we demonstrate both global and local Fréchet regression for demographic and brain imaging data. Local Fréchet regression is also illustrated via a simulation with response data which lie on the sphere.},

The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those with general interests in statistics. The important role of density estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text.Several contexts in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting, projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method, both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods, which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution, and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.},

PDFs are interpreted as functional compositions, which are objects carrying primarily relative information. In this context, the unit integral constraint allows to single out one of the possible representations of a class of equivalent measures. On these bases, a function-on-scalar regression model with distributional response is proposed, by relying on the theory of Bayes Hilbert spaces. The geometry of Bayes spaces allows capturing all the key inherent features of distributional data (e.g., scale invariance, relative scale). A B-spline basis expansion combined with a functional version of the centered log-ratio transformation is utilized for actual computations. For this purpose, a new key result is proved to characterize B-spline representations in Bayes spaces. The potential of the methodological developments is shown on simulated data and a real case study, dealing with metabolomics data. A bootstrap-based study is performed for the uncertainty quantification of the obtained estimates.},

In such models, predictors are Euclidean while responses are metric space valued. Predictor selection is of major relevance for regression modeling in the presence of multiple predictors but has not yet been addressed for Fréchet regression. Due to the metric space-valued nature of the responses, Fréchet regression models do not feature model parameters, and this lack of parameters makes it a major challenge to extend existing variable selection methods for linear regression to global Fréchet regression. In this work, we address this challenge and propose a novel variable selection method that overcomes it and has good practical performance. We provide theoretical support and demonstrate that the proposed variable selection method achieves selection consistency. We also explore the finite sample performance of the proposed method with numerical examples and data illustrations.},

These are both examples of functional data, which has become a commonly encountered type of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single- or multiple- index methods, we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models and models that feature time warping, manifold learning, and empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

  abstract = {We study in this paper a smoothness regularization method for functional linear regression and provide a unified treatment for both the prediction and estimation problems. By developing a tool on simultaneous diagonalization of two positive definite kernels, we obtain shaper results on the minimax rates of convergence and show that smoothness regularized estimators achieve the optimal rates of convergence for both prediction and estimation under conditions weaker than those for the functional principal components based methods developed in the literature. Despite the generality of the method of regularization, we show that the procedure is easily implementable. Numerical results are obtained to illustrate the merits of the method and to demonstrate the theoretical developments.},

  abstract = {Estimating an overall density function from repeated observations on each of a sample of independent subjects or experimental units is of interest. An example is provided by biodemographic studies, where one observes age-at-death for several cohorts of flies. Cohorts are kept in separate cages, which form the experimental units. Time variation then is likely to exist between the cohort densities and hazard rates due to cage effects on aging. Given the densities of age-at-death for the individual cohorts, one aims to obtain an estimate for the underlying overall density and hazard rate. In microarray gene expression experiments, similar problems arise when addressing the need for normalization of probe-level data from different arrays. Conventional methods, such as the cross-sectional average density, ignore time variation and hence are often not representative for such data. We view densities as functional data and model individual densities as warped versions of an underlying overall density, where the observed densities are assumed to be realizations of an underlying stochastic process. Quantile-synchronized distribution functions are obtained from an inverse warping mapping, based on quantile synchronization, leading to quantile-synchronized density and hazard functions. Kernel type smoothing methods with plug-in bandwidth selection can be used for estimating the components of the model. Asymptotic properties of the synchronized density estimates are derived. Simulation results show that functional density synchronization is often advantageous when compared to conventional density averaging or simple time-shift warping. Our approach complements previous quantile normalization methods used for microarray expression data and is illustrated with both longevity data obtained for 54 cohorts of mexflies (Mexican fruit flies) and gene expression data of the Ts1Cje mouse study for Down syndrome.},
