	abstract = {In functional linear regression, the slope “parameter” is a function. Therefore, in a nonparametric context, it is determined by an infinite number of unknowns. Its estimation involves solving an ill-posed problem and has points of contact with a range of methodologies, including statistical smoothing and deconvolution. The standard approach to estimating the slope function is based explicitly on functional principal components analysis and, consequently, on spectral decomposition in terms of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We discuss this approach in detail and show that in certain circumstances, optimal convergence rates are achieved by the {PCA} technique. An alternative approach based on quadratic regularisation is suggested and shown to have advantages from some points of view.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, statisticians are faced with the task of analyzing complex data that are non-Euclidean and specifically do not lie in a vector space. To address the need for statistical methods for such data, we introduce the concept of Fréchet regression. This is a general approach to regression when responses are complex random objects in a metric space and predictors are in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{p\}\$, achieved by extending the classical concept of a Fréchet mean to the notion of a conditional Fréchet mean. We develop generalized versions of both global least squares regression and local weighted least squares smoothing. The target quantities are appropriately defined population versions of global and local regression for response objects in a metric space. We derive asymptotic rates of convergence for the corresponding fitted regressions using observed data to the population targets under suitable regularity conditions by applying empirical process methods. For the special case of random objects that reside in a Hilbert space, such as regression models with vector predictors and functional data as responses, we obtain a limit distribution. The proposed methods have broad applicability. Illustrative examples include responses that consist of probability distributions and correlation matrices, and we demonstrate both global and local Fréchet regression for demographic and brain imaging data. Local Fréchet regression is also illustrated via a simulation with response data which lie on the sphere.},

	abstract = {Global Fréchet regression is an extension of linear regression to cover more general types of responses, such as distributions, networks, and manifolds, which are becoming more prevalent. In such models, predictors are Euclidean while responses are metric space valued. Predictor selection is of major relevance for regression modeling in the presence of multiple predictors but has not yet been addressed for Fréchet regression. Due to the metric space-valued nature of the responses, Fréchet regression models do not feature model parameters, and this lack of parameters makes it a major challenge to extend existing variable selection methods for linear regression to global Fréchet regression. In this work, we address this challenge and propose a novel variable selection method that overcomes it and has good practical performance. We provide theoretical support and demonstrate that the proposed variable selection method achieves selection consistency. We also explore the finite sample performance of the proposed method with numerical examples and data illustrations.},

	abstract = {The analysis of samples of random objects that do not lie in a vector space is gaining increasing attention in statistics. An important class of such object data is univariate probability measures defined on the real line. Adopting the Wasserstein metric, we develop a class of regression models for such data, where random distributions serve as predictors and the responses are either also distributions or scalars. To define this regression model, we use the geometry of tangent bundles of the space of random measures endowed with the Wasserstein metric for mapping distributions to tangent spaces. The proposed distribution-to-distribution regression model provides an extension of multivariate linear regression for Euclidean data and function-to-function regression for Hilbert space-valued data in functional data analysis. In simulations, it performs better than an alternative transformation approach where one maps distributions to a Hilbert space through the log quantile density transformation and then applies traditional functional regression. We derive asymptotic rates of convergence for the estimator of the regression operator and for predicted distributions and also study an extension to autoregressive models for distribution-valued time series. The proposed methods are illustrated with data on human mortality and distributional time series of house prices.},
